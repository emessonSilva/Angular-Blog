        "description": `My name is Emesson Silva, I'm 21 years old and I currently live in the city of Recife - PE.
        I finished high school in 2022 at IFPE - Campus Recife, there I also completed the building technician course.
        I'm currently doing a degree in I.T. with the systems analysis and development course at Faculdade Senac-PE,
        on the night shift and I'm in the 3rd period. In Jan/2024 I completed the FAP (Accelerated Training in Programming)
        in the Front-End part provided by Softex and there I learnt about web development. At the moment I am looking to enter the I.T. area (internship, CLT,...)
        in the development or data area, but I am always willing to learn new things.`,

        "description": `This Angular project is a game based on BuzzFeed tests, the theme is about The Avengers.
        It implements an interactive quiz to determine which Avenger you would be. Using a main component, it loads questions and options from a JSON database. 
        Users are guided through the questions, make choices, and their answers are collected. At the end, the system calculates the result based on the user's choices, consulting 
        the database to determine the corresponding Avenger character. The result is displayed along with an image associated with the chosen Avenger. The project stands out for its 
        integration of JSON data, interactivity, and dynamism provided by the Angular framework, offering an engaging and personalized user experience.

        "title": "E-Commerce Web",

        "description": `This React project is an e-commerce web application. It uses Next.js for server-side rendering and includes 
        a shopping cart functionality managed by a global state using React Context. The application fetches product data from a mock API 
        using Axios and displays a list of products on the home page. It utilizes Next UI components for a clean and responsive UI design.
        The loading state is handled gracefully with skeleton placeholders while data is being fetched. Users can add products to their 
        cart by clicking the "Comprar" (Buy) button, triggering an action dispatched to the global shopping cart context. The project also
        features error handling in case of connection issues with the server. Overall, it provides a user-friendly interface for browsing 
        and purchasing products in an e-commerce setting.
