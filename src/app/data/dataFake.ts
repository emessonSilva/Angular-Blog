        "description": `My name is Emesson Silva, I'm 21 years old and I currently live in the city of Recife - PE.
        I finished high school in 2022 at IFPE - Campus Recife, there I also completed the building technician course.
        I'm currently doing a degree in I.T. with the systems analysis and development course at Faculdade Senac-PE,
        on the night shift and I'm in the 3rd period. In Jan/2024 I completed the FAP (Accelerated Training in Programming)
        in the Front-End part provided by Softex and there I learnt about web development. At the moment I am looking to enter the I.T. area (internship, CLT,...)
        in the development or data area.`,

        technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Alura front-end immersion, which lasted 5 days, allowed me to 
        accomplish this project. I have made the project available on my GitHub, through the following link: https://github.com/emessonSilva/Spotify-Page .`,
