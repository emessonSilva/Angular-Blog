        I finished high school in 2022 at IFPE - Campus Recife, there I also completed the building technician course.
        I'm currently doing a degree in I.T. with the systems analysis and development course at Faculdade Senac-PE,
        on the night shift and I'm in the 3rd period. In Jan/2024 I completed the FAP (Accelerated Training in Programming)
        in the Front-End part provided by Softex and there I learnt about web development. At the moment I am looking to enter the I.T. area (internship, CLT,...)
        in the development or data area.`,

        technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Alura front-end immersion, which lasted 5 days, allowed me to 
        accomplish this project. I have made the project available on my GitHub, through the following link: https://github.com/emessonSilva/Spotify-Page .`,

        "description": `This Angular project is a game based on BuzzFeed tests, the theme is about The Avengers.
        It implements an interactive quiz to determine which Avenger you would be. Using a main component, it loads questions and options from a JSON database. 
        Users are guided through the questions, make choices, and their answers are collected. At the end, the system calculates the result based on the user's choices, consulting 
        the database to determine the corresponding Avenger character. The result is displayed along with an image associated with the chosen Avenger. The project stands out for its 
        integration of JSON data, interactivity, and dynamism provided by the Angular framework, offering an engaging and personalized user experience. 
        You can access this project through the following link: https://github.com/emessonSilva/BuzzFeed-Game .`,
